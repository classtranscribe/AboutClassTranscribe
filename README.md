* High visibility text, low distractions
* Transparent pause, quick rewind, continue-later, next video
* Caption editing, caption search across course
* Captions on mobile
* Course notes and book generation

COVID-19 Challenges
* ClassTranscribe is new and we've had our share of IT challenges when we had to expand suddenly to support 1000s of students. Fortunately we now have the deep experience and knowhow from NCSA to help build and scale this system.

Plans for the rest of 2020?
* Listening to students and faculty. We want to make ClassTranscribe work for everyone and helps alls students to learn better.
* Course notes and epub generation. We think creating books and notes from videos is an exciting way to help students engage more easily to the content. We're working closely with John Tubbs and his team at the Gies College of Business to understand how to help them create epubs and pdfs for their Coursera videos too.
* Scaling. Go west from the StateFarm Center and you'll bump into NCSA's National Petascale computing facility where NCSA is building a new compute loud. Rob Kooper at NCSA will be using ClassTranscribe to prove the capabilities of this cloud by simulating 52,331 virtual students as if every UIUC student were to simulatenously use ClassTranscribe on reading day.

FAQ

* I'm a student can I use ClassTranscribe? Sure! Many courses on ClassTranscribe are available for viewing after you login.

* Can I ask for new features? Sure - please contact us with your idea
* I'm a student can you put my current course on ClassTranscribe? Ask your instructor to contact us (see below).

* I'm an  instructor at UIUC, can I use ClassTranscribe for my course? Yes. Email classtranscribe aatt illinois.edu and include your course e.g. "Eng 123" and your MediaSpace channel or playlist URL. We will set it up for you. ClassTranscribe can automatically mirror and publish future content from your MediaSpace/Box account without any futher effort or time from you.

* Are you trying to replace MediaSpace? No. MediaSpace (Kaltura), is the university's official video storage and presentation system, which is used for more than just classes; we still suggest that faculty upload their videos there. If faculty want to also use ClassTranscribe to improve student learning in their course, we're here to help. ClassTranscribe can access the original content in MediaSpace even when Mediaspace servers are having difficulties or delays processesing the files.

* Why should I use ClassTranscribe? ClassTranscribe is a great interface from both learning and digital accessibility perspectives. It can help students learn more and learn more efficiently. Our research has found that students who use ClassTranscribe in CS and ECE courses earned higher grades on average and improved final exam scores after controlling for other factors (see for example our 2020 SIGCSE and ASEE papers).
