COVID-19 Challenges
* ClassTranscribe is new and we've had our share of IT challenges when we had to expand suddenly to support 1000s of students. Fortunately we now have the deep experience and knowhow from NCSA to help build and scale this system.

Plans for the rest of 2020?
* Listening to students and faculty. We want to make ClassTranscribe work for everyone and helps alls students to learn better.
* Course notes and epub generation. We think creating books and notes from videos is an exciting way to help students engage more easily to the content. We're working closely with John Tubbs and his team at the Gies College of Business to understand how to help them create epubs and pdfs for their Coursera videos too.
* Scaling. Go west from the StateFarm Center and you'll bump into NCSA's National Petascale computing facility where NCSA is building a new compute loud. Rob Kooper at NCSA will be using ClassTranscribe to prove the capabilities of this cloud by simulating 52,331 virtual students as if every UIUC student were to simulatenously use ClassTranscribe on reading day.
