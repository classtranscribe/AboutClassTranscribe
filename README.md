Plans for the rest of 2020?
Listening to students and faculty. We want to make ClassTranscribe work for everyone and helps alls students to learn better.
Better course notes and epubs. We think creating books and notes from videos is a great way to bring content to more students. We're working closely with John Tubbs of the Gies College of Business to understand how to help them create epubs and pdfs for their Coursera videos.
Scaling. Go west from the StateFarm Center and you'll bump into NCSA's National Petascale computing facility. Rob Kooper at NCSA is using ClassTranscribe to prove the capabilities of their new UIUC's own compute cloud system being created there. That's exactly 52,331 video connections if every UIUC student wanted to use ClassTranscribe on reading dat.
